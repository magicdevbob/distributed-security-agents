# Distributed Security Agents (DSA)

Welcome to the **Distributed Security Agents (DSA)** repository! This project represents the cutting edge in decentralized, AI-powered security systems designed for real-time threat detection and mitigation in distributed networks.

---

## **📚 Introduction**
In a world where cyberattacks grow increasingly sophisticated, traditional centralized security solutions can no longer keep up. DSA leverages:

- **AI-driven anomaly detection**
- **Blockchain-integrated transparency**
- **Federated learning for model evolution**

to create an autonomous, scalable, and fault-tolerant security ecosystem.

---

## **🚀 Features**

1. **Real-Time Threat Detection**: Utilize neural networks and clustering algorithms to identify anomalies.
2. **Blockchain Integration**: Immutable logs and consensus mechanisms to ensure transparency.
3. **Proactive Defense**: AI agents autonomously isolate threats and alert administrators.
4. **Decentralized Design**: Operates without single points of failure.
5. **Federated Learning**: Collaborative AI model training while preserving data privacy.

## **🛠️ Architecture**

### **Layered Design**

1. **Agent Layer**:
   - Distributed AI agents at network nodes perform local threat detection.
   - Federated learning optimizes model performance across agents.

2. **Consensus Layer**:
   - Blockchain ensures trust and coordination between agents.
   - Smart contracts automate security responses.

3. **Execution Layer**:
   - Enforces countermeasures such as transaction freezing and node isolation.

**Diagram**:

### **Mathematical Proof: Consensus Security**
We prove that DSA's consensus mechanism achieves Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT). Given a network of `n` agents:

**Theorem**: The system tolerates up to `f = ⌊(n-1)/3⌋` malicious agents.

**Proof**:
1. Let the total number of agents be `n = 3f + 1`.
2. For consensus, a majority of `2f + 1` honest agents must agree.
3. Since `n - f = 2f + 1`, the consensus is secure against up to `f` faults.

## **📊 Example Usage**

### Python Example
```python
from src.agents.anomaly_detector import detect_anomaly

data = [0.2, 0.3, 1.5, 0.4]  # Example network activity
result = detect_anomaly(data)
print("Anomaly detected:" if result else "No anomalies")
```

### Smart Contract Example (Solidity)
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Alert {
    event SecurityAlert(address indexed agent, string message);

    function triggerAlert(string memory message) public {
        emit SecurityAlert(msg.sender, message);
    }
}
```
